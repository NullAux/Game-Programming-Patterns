# Game Programming Patterns
 A practise project based on Nystrom, R. (2014) Game Programming Patterns, which attempts to implement the patterns described into a playable game.

Game Programming Patterns can be found at https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/
The following code closely follows the descriptions and examples by Nystrom, but aims to be an original implementation with room to grow.
The goal is to practise using most of the patterns described, which are realistically meant for specific scenarios. Expect many lengthly implementations which are only used for one part of the game. I may flesh out the project later, extending the test cases into a more functional game.
